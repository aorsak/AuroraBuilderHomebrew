    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Harrels are a simple community driven people. They may form small encampments and settlement, or they may be nomadic. Their feedom is put above all else.</p>

      <h4>SMALL AND PRACTICAL</h4>
      <p>The diminutive harrels survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p>
      <p class="indent">Harrels' fur ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.</p>
      <p class="indent">Harrel practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>

      <h4>KIND AND CURIOUS</h4>
      <p>Harrels are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.</p>
      <p class="indent">Harrels are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>

      <h4>PASTORAL PLEASANTRIES</h4>
      <p>Most harrels live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>
      <p class="indent">Many harrels live among other races, where the harrels' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>

      <h4>EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
      <p>Harrels usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p>

      <h4>HARREL NAMES</h4>
      <p>A harrel has a given name and a community name. These names almost always reflect nature, but may reflect something else if a harrel has had a unique life. A first name may change as a harrel grows up. Community names often reflect the location they grew up in. If the community has made a very long move, the new generations will often have new community names. </p>

    <description>
      <p>Pigmy Harrels are even smaller than any of their other relatives and much are more rare. They are tiny in size and range from 1.5 to 2 feet in height. Their fur is usually a brown agouti with a white belly. Their horns are very small. They often have a harder time grasping spoken languages and it may sound broken. This is due to their overall lower intelligence. This subrace is almost never found in cities, but instead in plains or forests with elaborate burrow systems used by small communities. They have poison resistance due to dealing with snakes often. They may be mistaken for animals by someone who does not know much about them. This can greatly anger them!</p>
